# Nuclear Energy Analysis Project

Overview

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of nuclear energy utilization in the United States. Our findings will be visualized through an interactive Flask App. The primary focus includes collecting data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration API, analyzing it using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, and storing the results in a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, we utilized JavaScript libraries such as Papa Parse, jQuery, Leaflet, and Highcharts to enhance our visualizations.

Methodology

1. Data Collection:
We gathered data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration API to ensure the accuracy and relevance of our analysis.

2. Data Processing and Analysis:
Utilizing the Pandas library and Jupyter Notebook, we processed the collected data to derive meaningful insights.
The processed data was exported as CSV files, which were subsequently converted to JSON for further compatibility.

3. Database Integration:
To enhance data management and accessibility, we imported the CSV files into a PostgreSQL database.

4. Visualization:
We employed the following JavaScript libraries for visualization: Papa Parse, jQuery, Leaflet, and Highcharts.

Created three visualizations:

Nuclear Plant Map:
Displays the geographical location of each nuclear plant.
Highlights the amount of nuclear outages for each plant in 2022.

Power Production Visualization:
Illustrates the amount of nuclear electric power production.
Includes insights into the operating units contributing to the production.
